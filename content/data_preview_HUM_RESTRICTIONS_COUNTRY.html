Otherwise, the few restrictions that there were (e.g. numbers of people allowed to travel on private minibus taxi services and certain businesses or shops only allowing a set number of people in at any one time) are loosening. The amplified music ban, which impacted social gatherings, has now been lifted. Some shops or businesses may still require customers to wear face masks, or to wash or sanitize hands before entry, or adhere to 3-6 feet space markings when queuing.</td>

      <td>*****Inbound restrictions:\nThere are currently commercial airline options. The Chilean Government maintais a prohibition on entry into the country, except for Chilean nationals and foreign nationals with valid residency visas for Chile. The restrictions do not apply to Chilean nationals or residents, diplomatic visa holders, or those providing humanitarian aid. All returning travellers are required to self-quarantine for 14 days. If travelling to the airport to catch a flight from one of the areas under quarantine or curfew, presenting passport and boarding pass will permit access across checkpoints. Use of a recognised taxi service or airport transfer whose driver should have the requisite permission. Chilean authorities require the use of masks in all public spaces/public transport, including the airport.\n\n*****Internal restrictions:\nQuarantine orders and sanitary cordons are in place in Santiago and in other parts of the country. Chile is deploying a flexible approach to bringing municipal areas (called communas) in and out of quarantine/sanitary cordons. New measures can be announced by the government at any time and come into force shortly after, although changes are typically announced every Wednesday and are applied from Fridays onwards. On 28 July, as part of the Chilean government’s step-by-step, five stage plan for the parts of Chile under quarantine orders to emerge in a phased manner from lockdown, five comunas in the Santiago metropolitan area - La Reina, Las Condes, Lo Barnechea, Ñuñoa, and Vitacura and the outlying towns of Colina and Til Til - moved from quarantine (Stage 1) into the ‘transition phase’ (Stage 2), along with two comunas in Valparaíso - San Antonio and San Felipe. Under this arrangement, in Stage 2, quarantine measures in those comunas are lifted between 0500 and 2200, Monday to Friday with those residing in the areas no longer having to apply for permission to leave their residence or to move within their communa. Social gatherings of no more than 10 people are allowed. However, quarantine measures remain in place at weekends and bank holidays, with the nationwide curfew still enforced seven days a week, as well as obligatory quarantine for those over 75 and a prohibition on movement to a secondary home.All other parts of the metropolitan region of Santiago and five neighbouring municipalities (San Bernardo, Buin, Puente Alto, Padre Hurtado and Lampa) remain under quarantine until at least 31 July (inclusive). In addition, the urban areas of Melipilla, Curacaví, Peñaflor and San José de Maipo are under quarantine orders until at least 31 July (inclusive). Full quarantine is also in place until at least 31 July (inclusive) in the Tarapacá region: in Iquique, Alto Hospicio, Pozo Almonte, and Los Andes; in the Valparaíso region: in Valparaíso and Viña del Mar; in the Antofagasta region: in the urban areas of Mejillones, Tocopilla and Antofagasta itself and in Calama; in the O’Higgins region: in Rancagua and Machalí; and in the El Maule region: in Curicó. Sanitary cordons are in place in San Antonio (Valparaíso), Pirque, Alto Biobío, Los Rios, Chiloé, Aysén, Punta Varas and Puerto Williams. Information on zones in quarantine is available on this Google interactive map [https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1cdg89HnDuW_y4-aenjiJ-hBfO5rRGNF3&amp;hl=es-419&amp;ll=-33.557598873589036%2C-70.47111591128419&amp;z=8]. In those areas in quarantine, people are allowed to leave their residences only under certain circumstances, including for medical reasons, basic services, and public services. If you need to leave your residence for food supplies or medical reasons, you must get a permit from the Comisaria Virtual [https://comisariavirtual.cl/]. Foreigners may use their passport number to access the system. The pages are only in Spanish. It is not possible to leave or enter a sanitary cordon without a “salvoconducto” (police authorization), also obtained via the Comisaria Virtual. Checkpoints for health inspections are in force at various points around Santiago and elsewhere. In addition to checking the health of persons passing through, these checkpoints will be used to confirm that specific individuals who have been ordered to quarantine by medical authorities are not violating their quarantine. You will need to get a “Health Passport” prior to travel and present it at any checkpoint [https://www.c19.cl/].</td>

      <td>Ukraine and Italy have completely lifted the restrictions for bilateral flights (112.International, 27.07.2020). Ukraine's government on Wednesday extended a nationwide lockdown to contain the coronavirus pandemic until 31 August. (VOA, 23.07.2020). \n\n*****International restrictions:\nFrom 15 June, Ukraine has reopened its borders to foreign nationals. Commercial flights are now operating to and from Ukraine on a limited number of routes.Ukraine has reopened its borders to foreign nationals. Upon arrival, all foreign nationals will be required to provide proof of health insurance that covers COVID-19 observation and treatment for the duration of their stay. Insurance must be purchased from a company registered in Ukraine or a foreign company that has a representative office or an insurance partner in Ukraine.\n**Transit: If you arrive from a country in the red zone and stay airside, you are not required to take insurance with COVID treatment coverage. For those entering Ukraine by land or sea and departing within two days of arrival, self-isolation or observation is not required. However, healthcare insurance for COVID-19 treatment and observation remains mandatory in this case. \nThe country from which you are travelling will dictate whether or not you are required to self-isolate for 14 days upon arrival in Ukraine. Travellers arriving from countries in what the Ukrainian authorities call the “red zone” (where COVID-19 case incidence in the previous 14 days has been higher than in Ukraine, and/or where the incidence has increased by over 30% in the previous 14 days) are required to undergo 14 days’ self-isolation proven by the “Dii Vdoma” tracking app, or quarantine in a Government-approved facility for 14 days upon arrival. Mandatory self-isolation or quarantine is no longer necessary if a traveller undergoes a PCR test and receives a negative result no more than 48 hours in advance of his/her arrival in Ukraine, or once in Ukraine. Further information about taking the tests in Ukraine and terminating self-isolation in case of a negative result can be found via the ‘more detailed’ link of the ‘for citizens of “red zone” countries’ box on the Ukrainian authorities’ [https://visitukraine.today/].\nTravellers arriving from countries in what the Ukrainian authorities call the “green zone” (where COVID-19 case incidence in the previous 14 days has been lower than in Ukraine, and where the incidence has increased by less than 30% in the last 14 days), are not required to undergo self-isolation or observation on arrival. Self-isolation on entry to Ukraine can be completed at your chosen address using the “Dii Vdoma” mobile app. You need to have a Ukrainian mobile phone number with the SIM card activated before you arrive in the country, though the SIM does not need to be in your phone on arrival. When using the app, you must respond promptly to notifications sent to your mobile (in Ukrainian).\nTravellers arriving in Ukraine or crossing the administrative points from non-government-controlled parts of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts and Crimea will be subject to health monitoring on arrival. More info: [https://visitukraine.today/].\n\n*****Internal restrictions:\nInternational and domestic flights have now resumed, although some carriers are operating a reduced schedule. Public transport in cities and bus and train travel between regions have also resumed on a reduced scale. When in public places, including when travelling on public transport and in taxis, you must maintain a minimum distance of 1.5 m, wear protective masks and gloves. The number of passengers per vehicle is limited to the number of seats, with the exception of metro carriages. Failure to comply with restrictions may result in a fine or, in more serious cases, a prison sentence. Before taking public transport, you should consider whether you will be able to maintain social distancing.Shops, restaurants, cafes, religious establishments, beauty salons and hairdressers, museums, libraries, hardware stores, cobblers, dentists, auditors, lawyers and notaries are now allowed to operate (providing appropriate measures are in place). The number of visitors to shopping centres, restaurants and sport facilities is limited to 1 person per 10 sq. m. Parks and recreation areas have reopened, with groups of up to eight people allowed to gather there. When in public places, including when travelling on public transport and in taxis, you must maintain a minimum distance of 1.5 m and wear protective masks and gloves. A maximum of four customers are allowed at a table in restaurants, cafes and bars (excluding children under 14 years old). Other restrictions are being eased in some regions, depending on the number of cases of coronavirus present and other criteria set out by the Ministry of Health. This includes the resumption of operation of gyms, fitness centres and swimming pools in most regions. The Government and local authorities have indicated that they may enact local lockdowns depending on the number of cases in differing regions.</td>
