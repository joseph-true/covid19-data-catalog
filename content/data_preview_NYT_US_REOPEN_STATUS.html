      <td>The state Supreme Court struck down Gov. Tony Evers's stay-at-home order on May 13, effectively lifting statewide restrictions on businesses in Wisconsin. Mr. Evers, a Democrat in a highly contested battleground state, had already announced plans for a gradual reopening but warned the ruling would cause “chaos.” Some counties have since placed their own restrictions on businesses. Mr. Evers mandated the use of face coverings in all public indoor places starting August 1.</td>
